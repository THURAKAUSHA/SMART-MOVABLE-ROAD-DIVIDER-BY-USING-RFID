# SMART-MOVABLE-ROAD-DIVIDER-BY-USING-RFID
To design and develop a Women Safety Night Robot that provides an extra layer of security and safety for women in areas with high crime rates, using advanced sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to detect suspicious activity and alert authorities
# EXISTING SYSTEM 
     Traditional personal safety devices often rely on manual activation, such as pressing a button, which may not be feasible in all situations. Additionally, these devices may not provide continuous tracking or real-time location updates, limiting their effectiveness in emergency situations. The lack of integration with emergency services and pre-defined contacts further reduces the responsiveness and reliability of existing systems.. 
# PROPOSED SYSTEM 
     The Women Safety Patrolling Robot, for instance, patrols designated areas, detects anomalies, and alerts authorities. Night patrol robots equipped with cameras and sensors also monitor streets to detect potential threats. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions like wearable devices and mobile apps provide women with instant access to help and support in emergency situations, offering an extra layer of security and safety, especially at night. 
# APPLICATIONS 
Night Patrol: Patrols designated areas at night to detect and prevent crimes against women. 
Emergency Response: Responds quickly to emergency situations, providing immediate assistance to women in distress. 
Crime Prevention: Deters potential criminals with its visible presence, reducing the likelihood of crimes against women. 
# System Design:
The RFID reader is strategically placed to detect EM18 Reader/Cards on vehicles or embedded in the road. As vehicles pass, the RFID reader collects data on their positions and transmits this information to the Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino processes the data and determines the optimal lane configuration based on current traffic conditions.
The motor driver, controlled by the Arduino, activates the DC motors to move the road divider. This allows the system to dynamically adjust lane configurations, optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion. The 16x2 LCD display provides real-time information on system status and lane configurations, ensuring that traffic personnel and drivers are informed of any changes.
The buzzer provides auditory alerts to indicate system operations, such as when the road divider is moving or when an RFID tag/card is detected. This enhances safety and ensures that all system operations are clearly communicated to users.
